# Recipe Creating Application

## Project Description

The Recipe Creating Application is a graphical user-interface application that was created using C# and Visual Studio. It was designed to simplify recipe creation and management, by offering a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, and adjusting recipes. The application allows users to enter the recipe details such as ingredients and cooking steps, which are then stored within the application while it's running in memory. The application has functions that allow the user to view stored recipes, scale ingredient quantities based on specified factors, and reset ingredient quantities to their original values. It also has a function which allows the user to clear all recipe data if they wish to start a new. By using the simple and intuitive menu design, users are able to easily and efficiently manage their recipes and ensure a seamless and enjoyable cooking experience.
